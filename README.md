# Neural-Networks-Project-Cats-vs-Dogs-and-MNIST
 This repository includes two image classification experiments built with CNNs: - Cats vs Dogs (binary classification) - MNIST Digits (10-class classification: 0 to 9)  The project provides a graphical user interface (`interface.py`) to run preprocessing, training (Baseline/Alternative and MinPooling variants), model loading, and image prediction.
